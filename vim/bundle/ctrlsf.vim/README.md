# ctrlsf.vim

An ack/ag powered code search and view tool, in an intuitive way with fairly more context.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [ack][1] or [ag][2] installed.

2. An easy way to install CtrlSF is using a package manager, like [pathogen][3], [vundle][4] or [neobundle][5].

    In vundle:

    ```vim
    Bundle 'dyng/ctrlsf.vim'
    ```

3. Read *Basic Usage* for more.

## Basic Usage

1. Run `:CtrlSF [pattern]`, it will split a new window to show search result.

2. Press `Enter` if you wanna jump to that file, or press `q` to quit.

3. Press `p` to explore file in a preview window if you only want a glance.

4. Running `:CtrlSFOpen` can reopen CtrlSF window if you are interested in other matches. It is free because it won't invoke a same but new search.

5. You can pass arguments like `-i`, `-C` or path directly to ack/ag backend in `:CtrlSF` command.

    ```vim
    CtrlSF -i -C 1 [pattern] /restrict/to/some/dir
    ```

## Key Maps

In CtrlSF window:

- `o`, `Enter` - Jump to file that contains the line under cursor.
- `t` - Like `o` but open file in a new tab.
- `p` - Like `o` but open file in a preview window.
- `O` - Like `o` but always leave CtrlSF window opening.
- `T` - Lkie `t` but focus CtrlSF window instead of opened new tab.
- `q` - Quit CtrlSF window.
- `<C-J>` - Move cursor to next match.
- `<C-K>` - Move cursor to previous match.

In preview window:

- `q` - Close preview window.

## Use Your Own Map

Besides the commands, there are also some useful maps.

- `<Plug>CtrlSFPrompt`

    Input `:CtrlSF ` in command line for you, just a handy alias.

- `<Plug>CtrlSFVwordPath`

    Input `:CtrlSF foo ` in command line where `foo` is the current visual selected word, waiting for further input.

- `<Plug>CtrlSFVwordExec`

    Similar to above, but execute it for you.

- `<Plug>CtrlSFCwordPath`

    Input `:CtrlSF foo ` in command line where `foo` is the word under cursor.

- `<Plug>CtrlSFPwordPath`

    Input `:CtrlSF foo ` in command line where `foo` is the last search pattern of vim.

For a detail list of all maps, please refer to the document file.

I strongly recommend you should do some maps for a nicer user experience, because 8 keystrokes for every single search are really boring even pain experience. Another reason is that **one of the most useful feature 'Search Current Visual Selection' can be accessed by map only.**

Example:

```
nmap     <C-F>f <Plug>CtrlSFPrompt
vmap     <C-F>f <Plug>CtrlSFVwordPath
vmap     <C-F>F <Plug>CtrlSFVwordExec
nmap     <C-F>n <Plug>CtrlSFCwordPath
nmap     <C-F>p <Plug>CtrlSFPwordPath
nnoremap <C-F>o :CtrlSFOpen<CR>
```

## Configuration

- `g:ctrlsf_ackprg` defines the external ack-like program which CtrlSF uses as source. If nothing is specified, CtrlSF will try *ag* first and fallback to *ack* if *ag* is not available. You can also explicitly define it by

    ```vim
    let g:ctrlsf_ackprg = 'ag'
    ```

- `g:ctrlsf_auto_close` defines the behavior of CtrlSF window after you press the `Enter`. By default CtrlSF window will automatically be closed if you jump to some file, you can prevent it by setting `g:ctrlsf_auto_close` to 0.

    ```vim
    let g:ctrlsf_auto_close = 0
    ```

- `g:ctrlsf_context` defines how to print lines around the matching line (refer to `ack`'s [manual][6]). It is default to be `-C 3`, you can overwrite it by

    ```vim
    let g:ctrlsf_context = '-B 5 -A 3'
    ```

A full doc about options can be found in `:help ctrlsf-options`.

## Why not ack.vim or ag.vim ?
1. ack.vim depends on vim's builtin `:grep` command, so you can't custom output format. What makes me to write this plugin is that I find reading lines with no highlight and no context is totally a pain. (Using `:cnext` and `:cprevious` can relieve it, yes.)
2. Fix a misescape bug in ack.vim (and also ag.vim), it lets you can use literal '#' and '%' without annoying escape now. For more information, check [manual][7] of ack.vim.
3. ag.vim is actually a fork of ack.vim with minor change.
